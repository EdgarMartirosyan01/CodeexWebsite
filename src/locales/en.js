As if that weren’t enough, our next step was creating a digital world – a Metaverse platform that features an environment where people can buy land parcels, make investments, do mining and trading.

Because these products and similar ones will be in mainstream utility years from now.

On the other hand, the GSM market is slowly dying.",
